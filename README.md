# Rapid Forge - A TypeScript Full Stack Starter Code

Rapid Forge is a Full Stack starter code for building web applications using TypeScript.

On the client side, we use:

- Vite
- React
- Tanstack Query with tRPC
- Tanstack Router
- Shadcn UI

On the server side, we use:

- Node.js
- Express
- Drizzle ORM
- PostgreSQL

We also use a few other libraries and tools:

- Zod for data validation
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Getting Started

1. Clone or [use this repository as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. If you cloned the repository, remove the .git folder. If you used the template, clone your own repository.
3. Install client dependencies and run the client with the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. In another tab, install server dependencies and run the server with the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the project in your favorite editor (there are some settings configured for VSCode) and start coding!
